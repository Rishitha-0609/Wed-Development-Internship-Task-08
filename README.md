### About The Project
The objective was to create a clean blog page that includes all the essential elements of a modern web layout: a navigation bar, a main content area with post cards, a sidebar, and a footer.
The entire layout is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
### Key Features
Responsive Navigation Bar: A dark, sticky-top navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Hero Section: A welcoming header to introduce the blog.
Two-Column Layout: A main content area for blog posts and a sidebar for auxiliary information like "About" and "Categories".
Responsive Card Grid: Blog posts are displayed in a responsive grid that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen width.
Styled Cards: Each card includes an image, title, short description, and a "Read More" button, with a subtle shadow and hover effect.
Sticky Sidebar: The sidebar remains visible on the screen as the user scrolls through the posts on larger devices.
Pagination: A standard pagination component to navigate between pages of blog posts.
Footer with Icons: A clean footer with copyright information and social media links using Font Awesome icons.
